        <h3 className="text-xl mb-4 font-bold">1 - CaskBlock - How does it work</h3>
        Distilleries will have their products digitally represented by NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on CaskBlock.
        The NFT functions similarly to a bearer bond serving as both a certificate of ownership and a contract outlining the terms of sale.
        The buyer accesses CaskBlock to purchase the desired product and receives the NFT in their encrypted digital wallet as a certificate of ownership.
        Once the purchase is finalized the distillery will automatically receive the payment in fiat currency.
        Each NFT represents a unique product and the terms on which it was purchased. It cannot be copied reproduced or altered in any way by anyone. It has been engraved in the blockchain forever.
        Whoever possesses the NFT can redeem or trade it. This allows for the ownership of the asset to be passed on without any actual physical movement or intervention by any third party at all. Transactions are fast making it easily accessible to a larger number of buyers without any intervention.
        The distillery will be able to track every transaction of the products they have sold (if it hasn’t been redeemed).
        In summary NFTs provide a secure and immutable way to represent ownership of digital assets allowing seamless transfer without physical handling or intermediaries. The blockchain ensures transparency and traceability.

        <h3 className="text-xl mb-4 font-bold">4 - What is an NFT?</h3>
        A non-fungible token (NFT) is a digital asset that represents ownership of a unique item such as a piece of art music or even virtual real estate. NFTs are stored on a blockchain a decentralized and secure digital ledger that records transactions transparently and immutably. Unlike traditional currency or other assets that are interchangeable and have the same value NFTs are unique and cannot be exchanged for items of equal value. This makes them well-suited for representing ownership of one-of-a-kind items or digital assets that are not interchangeable. NFTs have gained popularity in recent years as a way to authenticate and sell digital art collectibles and other unique items. They have also been used to represent ownership of physical assets such as real estate or rare collectibles.

        <h3 className="text-xl mb-4 font-bold">5 - What is a Token?</h3>
        A token is a digital asset that represents a certain value usually in the form of a cryptocurrency or other digital asset. Tokens are often used as a means of exchange or a store of value similar to traditional currencies. Tokens can be issued and managed by various organizations including businesses governments and even individuals. They serve multiple purposes including fundraising voting and creating incentives for certain behaviours.
        <br/>
        There are two main types of tokens: utility tokens and security tokens. Utility tokens grant access to a specific product or service and can be used to purchase or trade for that product or service. Security tokens on the other hand represent ownership in an asset such as a company or real estate and are subject to federal securities regulations. Tokens can be stored in a digital wallet and traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges.

        <h3 className="text-xl mb-4 font-bold">6 - What is a Blockchain?</h3>
        A blockchain is a decentralized and secure digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks and gaining the consensus of the network. Blockchains are used to store and record transactions for a wide variety of assets including financial transactions property records and even votes. They are particularly useful for recording transactions that need to be secure and transparent as the record of transactions on a blockchain cannot be altered or deleted once it has been added.
        <br/>
        A blockchain consists of a series of blocks each containing a list of transactions. When a new transaction is added to the blockchain it is verified by network nodes through a process called "consensus." Once a transaction is verified it is added to the blockchain in the form of a new block which is linked to the previous block. This creates a chain of blocks hence the name "blockchain."
        <br/>
        Blockchains are secure because they use cryptographic techniques to ensure that transactions cannot be altered once they have been added. They are also decentralized meaning they are not controlled by a single entity but are maintained by a network of users. This makes them resistant to censorship and tampering.

        <h3 className="text-xl mb-4 font-bold">7 - What is a Crypto Wallet?</h3>
        A cryptocurrency wallet also known as a digital wallet is a software program that stores private and public keys and interacts with various blockchains to enable users to send and receive digital currency and monitor their balance. If you want to use Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency you will need to have a digital wallet. Cryptocurrency wallets come in different forms including desktop mobile online hardware and paper wallets. Each type of wallet has its own set of features and benefits so it's important to choose the one that best meets your needs.
        <br/>
        <strong>Desktop Wallets:</strong> Installed on a computer these wallets offer a high level of security but require the user to download the entire blockchain and keep their computer online to interact with the network.
        <br/>
        <strong>Mobile Wallets:</strong> These are apps that can be downloaded to a smartphone providing a convenient way to access and manage your digital assets on the go.
        <br/>
        <strong>Online Wallets:</strong> Also known as web wallets these are accessed through a web browser and are generally less secure than other types of wallets.
        <br/>
        <strong>Hardware Wallets:</strong> Physical devices that store your private keys offline offering an extra layer of security.
        <br/>
        <strong>Paper Wallets:</strong> Printed copies of your public and private keys used as a way to store your cryptocurrencies offline.
        <br/>
        Regardless of the type of wallet you choose it's important to keep your private keys and passwords secure and regularly back up your wallet to prevent the loss of your digital assets.
